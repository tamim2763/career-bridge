/// # Query Parameters
/// 
/// - `experience_level` - Optional filter by experience level
/// - `job_type` - Optional filter by job type
/// - `limit` - Maximum results to return (default: 10)

/// # Returns
/// 
/// A list of job recommendations sorted by match score (highest first).
/// Each recommendation includes:
/// - The job details
/// - Match score percentage
/// - Matched skills
/// - Missing skills

/// # Errors
/// 
/// Returns an error if:
/// - User is not authenticated
/// - Database operation fails
